# Github Browser
Browse github orderly.

### Features
- Gives you **only 1 page** (no tabs, no clutter. just focus). If you really, really must see a link in another window you can use "Preview" feature (cmd+click or right-click on a link/image)
- Minimalist & functional design
- Dock **badge** shows the number of new notifications
- Tweaked github css to make it responsive and hide unimportant blocks (headers, footers)
- Has 4 main sections:
  - notifications - see what's going on, and dismiss merged PRs without leaving the page
  - bookmarks - stash any page. Issue/PR pages are grouped by repository name. PR bookmarks will show build job progress (tested only with jenkins for now)
  - my issues - work in progress
  - projects - a view of all projects for a default repository
- **Auto updater** (like chrome - updates the app in the background)
- Works with **Github Enterprise**
- **TouchBar** Support
