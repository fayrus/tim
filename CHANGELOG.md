# Changelog



### v0.25.0 (2017-03-23)
- faster page loading and back navigation
- added "hide" menu option for mac
- nicer badge background (to match the dock badge red)
- user names will now be fetched using the API if token was provided
- some cleanup and some refactoring
- when there are tonnes of notifications a "show more" button shows up. When clicked - it was navigating the notifications sidebar without a way to go back. "Back Button" will now show up in the sidebar, when it's needed!
